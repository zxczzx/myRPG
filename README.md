Easy RPG with SFML game engine
Written in C++/Lua

- Development branch - adding SFML GUI
- master branch - stable console game

Files seems to be in a bit of mess. If you want to read those files I recommend to open solution in Visual Studio where filters are added.

To compile project you will need to change project properties and add LuaBridge to your project which is in project folder:
project Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories
To compile project from development branch add SFML to project. For more informations:
