# myRPG
Easy RPG (console) game with no 3rd party game engines (so far)
Written in C++/Lua

Files seems to be in a bit of mess. If you want to read those files I recommend to open solution in Visual Studio where filters are added.

To compile project you will need to change project properties and add LuaBridge to your project which is in project folder:
project Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories
